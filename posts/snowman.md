*Perspective of a human,*

*As the sun's relentless rays bore down upon the snowman, its icy form began to drip and melt, droplets of water trickling down like tears from its coal-black eyes. Yet, this was no ordinary snowman; imbued with ancient magic, its dissolution sparked an unexpected transformation. The water seeped into the earth, awakening dormant energies that surged through the soil. From its melting body arose tendrils of frosty mist, spreading swiftly across the land. What started as a humble snowman now grew into an unstoppable force, its icy essence merging with rivers, lakes, and seas. The world succumbed to its icy embrace, cities freezing over, forests encased in frost, and oceans turning to solid ice. The snowman, now an elemental colossus, reigned supreme, a frozen sovereign of a world gripped in eternal winter.*
