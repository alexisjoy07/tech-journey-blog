*Mr Krabs has got an itch to step*

*SpongeBob's normally sunny disposition had reached its breaking point as Patrick inadvertently stumbled into yet another disastrous scheme. "Patrick, no!" SpongeBob cried out, slapping his best friend gently on the head in frustration. Patrick, unfazed as always, simply grinned and shrugged. Meanwhile, in the chaos, Plankton saw his chance and stealthily snatched the precious Krabby Patty secret formula. With an evil cackle, he scurried away, clutching the formula tightly to his chest. However, his moment of triumph was short-lived. Just as Plankton gloated over his victory, a gigantic boot belonging to none other than Sandy Cheeks came crashing down from above, completely squashing him flat. SpongeBob and Patrick, oblivious to Plankton's fate, continued their bickering over who would get the last jellyfish jelly sandwich, unaware of the dramatic events that had just unfolded nearby.*
